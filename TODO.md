# TODO

## Alpha

* work out why console.log messages not being shown from sim or phone

* Style the screen nicely
* Pulse when timer is close to running out
* Beep when timer has run out
* Alarm after timer has been run out for a while


## Beta

* Use location to set brightness of screen - should be an option
* Store the duration between sessions
* Let user change settings in config
* Day and Night modes

## Nice to have

* Store location for past interactions as a thing to refer to if there is a MOB situation.
