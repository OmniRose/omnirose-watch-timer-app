# TODO

## Alpha

* Style the screen nicely
* Add settings

## Beta

* Use location to set brightness of screen - should be an option
* Store the duration between sessions
* Let user change settings in config
* Day and Night modes

## Trickier

* Trigger alerts and alarms even when app is in background.

## Nice to have

* Store location for past interactions as a thing to refer to if there is a MOB situation.
